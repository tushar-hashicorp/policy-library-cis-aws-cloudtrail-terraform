## Description

CIS recommends that every Cloudtrail has KmsKeyId set. 

This policy verifies whether the `aws_cloudtrail` is configured to use the server-side encryption (SSE) AWS KMS key encryption. 
The policy fails if the `kms_key_id` attribute isn't defined for the resource.

This rule is covered by the [cloudtrail-server-side-encryption-enabled](../../policies/cloudtrail-server-side-encryption-enabled.sentinel) policy.
