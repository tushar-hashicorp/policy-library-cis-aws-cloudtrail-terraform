## Description

DISCLAIMER - This policy works when all resources of type (aws_cloudtrail, aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block) are in the root module
and S3_bucket references could either be a string or reference to the aws_s3_bucket resource.
If the resources are in different modules, the policy will not work as expected. 

CloudTrail logs a record of every API call made in your account. These log files are stored in an S3 bucket. 
CIS recommends that the S3 bucket policy, or access control list (ACL), applied to the S3 bucket that CloudTrail 
logs to prevents public access to the CloudTrail logs. 
Allowing public access to CloudTrail log content might aid an adversary in identifying weaknesses in 
the affected account's use or configuration.

This rule is covered by the [cloudtrail-logs-bucket-not-public](../../policies/cloudtrail-logs-bucket-not-public.sentinel) policy.
